            <h2> Summary </h2>
            <p> This assignment focused on defining a problem statement for the Pierce School Bridge. The video for the assignment can also be seen below.</p>
            <br>
            <p> The current situation is that students need to cross the road in order to both enter and leave the school. Hence, a bridge was built as seen in the video - despite this, students still decided to cross the street itself. The reason being that, using the bridge was not efficient - and required to much time and effort. </p>
            <br>
            <p>A better solution to this might be a more efficient bridge whereby, students don't need to climb up a spiral stair case - this would help with foot traffic, and making sure that the staircase can handle 2 lines of people. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Another option could be using a double set of speed bumps to slow cars down prior to the crossing. This would provide enough time for the children to cross, while also forcing the drivers to slow down and proceed carefully through the crossing. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Both solutions can be seen in the below sketches.</p>

                <p>
                    An alternate design for the bridge allows for 2 lines of students to cross at the same time. Additionally, they can continue walking and will not loose any momentum while crossing.

                <h2> 2. Speed Bumps </h2>
                <p>
                    A dual set of speed bumps could be used on both sides to reduce the speed of incoming cars. Students would have enough time to cross the street, and drivers would have more time to react to students who are crossing.
