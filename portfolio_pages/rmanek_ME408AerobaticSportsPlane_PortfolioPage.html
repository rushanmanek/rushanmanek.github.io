            <h2> Summary </h2>
            <p> 
                Over the period of the Fall 2022 semester I took attended an Aircraft Performance & Design Course (ME408). During this course, we had the opportunity of working as groups to create a plane based on required specifications set forth by the customer (in this case - our professor). <br>
                <br>
                Our team chose the aerobatic sports plane as our project. And through that we had a variety of customer specifications to meet - these can be seen in the Table below.

            <p> At the start of our design process, our team initially decided to pursue a dual certification for both LSA and Aerobatic aircraft. However, as we went through the design process - we realised that due to the tight requirements of the LSA certificate - we would not be able to achieve both certifcates together. Hence, since the primary certification that we were aiming to achieve was the aerosport certification - we instead opted to pursue an Aerobatic and Military dual cert. Whilst this did alter some of the requirements of the aircraft (max cruise speed, armament payload, etc.) we felt that it was a better alternative. Especially, as there are few military and aerobatic dual certs currently in the market. </p>

    <div class="project-description section1">
        <h2> 1. Empty Weight & Matching Chart </h2>
        <p> The first part of the project consisted of determining the empty weight and design point of the aircraft. Based on the requirements set forth from the list above, the following parameters were met - yielding an empty weight & design point seen in the images below. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-description section2">
        <h2> 2. Engine Selection & Propeller Design, Takeoff & Landing Analysis, Enhanced Lift Design </h2>
        <p> The second part of the project consisted in designing the main airfoil design, as well the airfoil for the horizontal and vertical stabilisers. It was clear that based on the requirement of inverted flight - a symmetrical airfoil would be required. Hence, the NACA 63-015 was determined as the best option. With regards to the empennage. The NACA 0009 was used for both the horizontal and vertical stabilisers. A summary of the airfoil design as well the side & top views can be found in the images below.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Additionally, whilst designing the fuselage for the aircraft, the team went through multiple iterations in attempting to make sure there was adequate volume to fit all the necessary equipment, payload and passengers. In the initial design concept whilst the team was focused on pursuing a dual LSA & aerobatic cert the fuselage consisted of a tandem seating arrangement. However, once the team pivoted to the dual military and aerobatic cert we opted for utilising a linear (back-to-front) seating arrangement based on competitor data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-description section3">
        <h2> 3. Engine Selection & Propeller Design, Takeoff & Landing Analysis, Enhanced Lift Design </h2>
        <p> The third part of the project focused on the takeoff & operational aspect of the aircraft. Based on the fact we were aiming for a military and aerobatic dual cert, we felt the most efficient engine to use would be one that has constant speed and allows for variable pitch. Based on this, and competitor data the GE M60-1D-2 was chosen as the engine. Additionally with regards to the propellor design a focus was made on trying to optimise for takeoff, as this was the limiting factor based on the large payload at the beginning. Hence, a wider diameter propeller of 7.5 ft was used with 3 blades at the speeds shown below. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The takeoff & landing field analysis was based upon literature values from Corke (YEAR). From here, it was calculated that the aircraft would require a takeoff & landing field length of at least 2,317 ft & 1,289 ft respectively.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With regards to the enhanced lift design, a slotted flap design was used in order to achieve as much lift as possible, whilst still attempting to maintain a lower cost compared to other alternatives (such as fowler flaps). This was also supported by our competitor data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-description section4">
        <h2> 4. Material Selection, Stability Analysis, Cost Analysis</h2>
        <p> The last part of the project looked at the various material specifications for the aircraft. Whereby Aluminium was chosen as the primary material. Furthermore, a longitudinal stability analysis was performed on the aircraft. This was an iterative process and was performed by varying the SM (stability Margin) of the aircraft.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the end a cost analysis was performed on the aircraft - yielding an MSRP of $2,867,847, at a 10% margin.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-description section5">
        <h2> 5. Extra Notes</h2>
        <p> One thing to note for this assignment is that due to the fact that most of the calculations were being done based on correlative data, it was difficult to obtain  accurate information for our specific type of aircraft. Consequently, not all our values were a true/accurate representation of what the final aircraft might be able to achieve - both in terms of performance as well as pricing.</p>
