        <h2> 1. Context </h2>
        <p> Throughout Boston, there are instances seen on the left - where its residents are subject poor sewer systems that easily get clogged up by fallen leaves and debris, with no way of cleaning them. The result is a sidewalk crossing that is flooded, and makes walking along & across the street difficult.</p>

            <img src="../images/project_SewerExercise/rmanek_SewerExercise_ProblemPicture2.png" style="float: right; width:30%; margin-right:10px; margin-top: 10px;">

        <h2> 2. Problem & Solution </h2>
        <!--<img src="../images/project_SewerExercise/rmanek_SewerExercise_ProblemPicture2.png" style="float: left; width:30%; margin-right:10px">-->
        <p> The problem at hand boils down to the fact that there is no efficient way to clear out the leaves that rest on top of the sewer grating. As a result, every time it rains, they collect atop of the grating - clogging the inlets. Furthermore, because they are not cleaned frequently (due to the time required to sweep everything together and off the grate). The sidewalks stay flooded for days.</p>
        <br>    
        <p>A possible solution for this issue could be to create a more efficient way to collect the leaves, thus allowing for more frequent cleaning to help reduce the risk & period of flooding.</p>

        <h2> 3. Design </h2>
        <!--<img src="../images/project_SewerExercise/rmanek_SewerExercise_ProblemPicture2.png" style="float: left; width:30%; margin-right:10px">-->
        <p>One possible design that would help achieve this solution can be seen below. Whereby, a tray contained slits/grates is placed with its open end flush with the surface of the road. This would allow the water to pass through the slits, whilst collecting the leaves in a centralised location - below surface level - to decrease the effect of flooding. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Additionally, the tray is removable, allowing for easy cleanup once it gets filled with leaves, reducing the time required - and increasing the frequency of the clean-ups.</p>
