            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> My Name is Rushan Manek. Having been born in Fullterton, CA; raised in Nairobi, Kenya; and being Indian - I embody what it means to have a diverse background.</p>
            <br>
            <p> This diversity is represented not only in my character, but also in my engineering. I'm always striving to learn new skills, and take on new challenges. I firmly believe in being a "jack of all trades", and  this is represented in my wide-skill set which encompasses a complete set of skills ranging from Hardware to Software, including: CAD, manufacturing, machining, and coding. </p>
            <br>
            <p> I am currently in my final year of Mechanical Engineering at Boston University, and am actively looking for jobs in the aerospace & robotics fields in the hope of continuing my adventures in this field.</p>
